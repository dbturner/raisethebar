**Question 1:** What is the sample size for each group?

<choice>
<opt text="all groups have large (>30) sample size">

How can you tell what the sample size is from this graph?

</opt>

<opt text="all groups have small (<10) sample size">

How can you tell what the sample size is from this graph?

</opt>


<opt text="the number in each group is unclear, but they are all the same sample size">

How can you tell that the sample sizes are equal from this graph?

</opt>

<opt text="the number in each group is not clear from this graph" correct="true">

Good job! There is no way to tell from the graph given here what the sample size is for each group.

**Question 2:** Mussels lengths in both locations in all four years display a normal distribution.

<choice>
<opt text="True">

How can you tell what the distribution of mussels lengths is from this graph?

</opt>

<opt text="False">

How can you tell what the distribution of mussels lengths is from this graph?

</opt>


<opt text="Unclear" correct="true">

Good job! There is no way to tell from the graph given here what the distribution is for each group.

**Question 3:** What is the length of the largest mussel?

<choice>
<opt text="None of the groups have mussel shell lengths greater than 80mm">

How can you tell what the maximum mussel length is from this graph?

</opt>

<opt text="All of the groups have a maximum mussel shell length that is greater than 80mm">

How can you tell what the maximum mussel length is from this graph?

</opt>


<opt text="The largest mussel shell in all the groups is approximately 131 mm long">

How can you tell what the maximum mussel length is from this graph?

</opt>

<opt text="The largest mussel shell length in all the groups is approximately 79 mm long">

How can you tell what the maximum mussel length is from this graph?

</opt>

<opt text="It is unclear from this graph what the maximum mussel shell length is for each group" correct="true">

Good job! There is no way to tell from the graph given here what the maximum mussel length is.
