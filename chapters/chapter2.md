<exercise id="2" title="Making a Dot Plot">

Let's try making a simple dot plot with the mussel length data. To start, let's just look at some code to import data and make a simple graph.
In the code chunk below (gray box), there are several lines of code that will load the packages needed, import the mussel length data, and make a graph comparing the lengths of all the mussels from the two rivers.

To help you understand what the different parts of the code do, there are comments included.  Any text after the "#" is considered a comment and is ignored by R. Keep in mind that you should always heavily comment your own code when you start writing code so your future self remembers what your past self did and why.

To run the code, click the "Run Code" button.

There are no blanks here, so you don't really need a hint. But feel free to click "Reset" if you change anything and want to change it back.
