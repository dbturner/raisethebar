# Bar Graphs with Means and Error Bars Can Be Misleading

- Does not show the distribution, range, or sample size of the actual values
- Misleads because of common belief that values fall within the bar rather than above
- You can get the same bars with very different distributions


Notes: Did those previous three questions help you see that bar graphs can be misleading? See [Weissgerber et al. 2019 paper from the journal Circulation](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.037777)(as well as the references cited within) for a good overview of why it is recommended that you DO NOT use bar graphs for data with continuous dependent variables grouped by a categorical independent variable.

## Bar graphs do not allow us to answer questions about the distribution, sample size, or range of data.

Are there other graph types that can help use answer these questions more effectively?

# Other Graph Types

There are lots of other graphs types that can be useful for data with continuous dependent variables grouped by a categorical independent variable.

Here are some resources if you would like to familiarize yourself with some alternative graph types

Notes: If you are unfamiliar with box plots, violin plots, histograms, and/or dot plots, then check out these resources to help you understand the different graph types we will be discussing next in more detail before you move to the next section. A note on terminology for the 4th graph type above - we use the term "dot plot" here, but a plot that shows all the points for different groups can also be called a beewarm-stye plot, jitter plot, violin scatter plot, column scatter plot, jittered strip plot, jittered individual value plot, among others.
