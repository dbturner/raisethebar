# Why Bar Graphs Are Misleading

Notes: This website is an introduction to why bar graphs can be misleading and what alternatives can be used instead

# How does the population of *Elliptio complanata* mussels differ through time and location?

Notes: Smith College faculty and students sampled *Elliptio complanata* mussels in two rivers in Western Massachusetts in June of 2016-2019 to determine whether or not the college's management of sediment in Paradise Pond was impacting the mussels. At each sampling time, we set up a 10m by 30m area in the river and then chose x and y coordinates of predetermined number of random starts (in this case 3) using a systematic sampling technique (pages 10-18 in Strayer and Smith 2003). We placed a 50 cm x 50 cm quadrat at each set of coordinates, looked with a view bucket to see if any mussels were at the surface, then we excavated the substratum with a trowel or gloved hands down to about 15 cm. The excavated substrate was passed through a sieve with 4.67 mm mesh. All mussels found were identified to species, counted (also noted if on the surface or under the surface, alive or dead), and had their length measured to the 0.1mm.

#Mussel Density

<img src="table.png" alt="Table showing the locations (Manhan and Mill), years (2016-2019), number of quadrats sampled (21-56 depending on the year and location), and density of Elliptio complanata mussels in number per meters squared" width="90%"/>

Notes: The density of mussels decreased in the Manhan River, but increased in the Mill River overall. How did the mussel size change?

Notes: This graph shows the average and standard error for shell length in each river in each year for live *Elliptio complanata* mussels
