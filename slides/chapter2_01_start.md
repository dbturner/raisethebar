# Getting Started in R

Why use R?

- Itâ€™s free, open source
- TONS of resources & flexibility
  - Lots of packages & functions specific to ecology
  - Online R community
  - Cool graphs: [R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/)
- Reproducible
  - Many journals now require code for analysis to be shared
  - Everything (clean, analyze, plot, communicate data) all in one
- Highly transferable skill
- Used by an increasing number of ecologists


Notes: We can use R (an opensource programming language and environment) to make just about any graph you want, but it is not the easiest to learn. So why learn R? R is useful to learn because it is free, flexible, reproducible, transferable, and used by an increasing number of ecologists. When it comes to graphing grouped continuous data like, we saw in chapter 1 that bar graphs can be misleading and there are a variety of other graph types that are better. Some of these graph types (such as dot plots) can be really hard to get other software to do well (for example, Excel can't do them well).

# Can You Learn R or Teach it to Students with NO Experience?

## YES!
Starting with code templates to make different graph types can be a relatively easy way to start learning for faculty, researchers, and students alike.

Notes: Smith College faculty and students sampled *Elliptio complanata* mussels in two rivers in Western Massachusetts in June of 2016-2019 to determine whether or not the college's management of sediment in Paradise Pond was impacting the mussels. At each sampling time, we set up a 10m by 30m area in the river and then chose x and y coordinates of predetermined number of random starts (in this case 3) using a systematic sampling technique (pages 10-18 in Strayer and Smith 2003). We placed a 50 cm x 50 cm quadrat at each set of coordinates, looked with a view bucket to see if any mussels were at the surface, then we excavated the substratum with a trowel or gloved hands down to about 15 cm. The excavated substrate was passed through a sieve with 4.67 mm mesh. All mussels found were identified to species, counted (also noted if on the surface or under the surface, alive or dead), and had their length measured to the 0.1mm.
