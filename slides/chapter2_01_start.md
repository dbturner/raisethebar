# Getting Started in R

### Why use R?

- Itâ€™s free, open source
- TONS of resources & flexibility
  - Lots of packages & functions specific to ecology
  - Online R community
  - Cool graphs: [R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/)
- Reproducible
  - Many journals now require code for analysis to be shared
  - Everything (clean, analyze, plot, communicate data) all in one
- Highly transferable skill
- Used by an increasing number of ecologists


Notes: We can use R (an opensource programming language and environment) to make just about any graph you want, but it is not the easiest to learn. So why learn R? R is useful to learn because it is free, flexible, reproducible, transferable, and used by an increasing number of ecologists. When it comes to graphing grouped continuous data like, we saw in chapter 1 that bar graphs can be misleading and there are a variety of other graph types that are better. Some of these graph types (such as dot plots) can be really hard to get other software to do well (for example, Excel can't do them well).

# Can You Learn R or Teach it to Students with NO Experience?

## YES!

Starting with code templates to make different graph types can be a relatively easy way to start learning R for faculty, researchers, and students alike that result in professional looking graphs.

Notes: Graphs are fun to make and if you have a code template or example to tweak, it isn't that hard to make an impressive one. Manipulating data (often called "data wrangling") to get it in the right format to use in analysis can often be the hardest part of any analysis process (and learning how to do this with code is a steep learning curve). So you can have novice learners prepare the data in a spreadsheet program they already know (such as Excel or Google Sheets), import into R (or provide cleaned up data already imported), and then use code templates to get the graphs you want.

# Learn How to Use Code Templates to Make Graphs
In the next few sections, you will learn how to use code templates to make graphs in R

Notes: When learning as a novice or teaching novices, it can be helpful to start with most of the code for a particular graph type already written with just some blanks for the data, variables, and labels. Then users can fill in the blanks and tweak the code as desired if they want to try changing other aspects (colors, size, fonts, etc). During very first exposures, it can be helpful if the learner doesn't have to install anything - not R or RStudio (the two software packages needed to run R locally on your computer) and not any packages (packages that can expand the capabilities of base R to do all kinds of things are often needed and must be installed before first use).  

The "Raise the Bar" website is one option for exposing novices to how to make some different graphs using R code templates without having to install anything. All you need is a browser and internet access.
